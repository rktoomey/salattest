This project was built to experiment with Scala / MongoDB / Casbah / Salat,
and attempt to practice inserting, updating, querying, and deleting DB
records.

dao.update doesn't appear to do anything, but throws no exceptions

explicit connections to "localhost",27017 do a lookup of the local
hostname instead of finding 127.0.0.1, and thus fail.
